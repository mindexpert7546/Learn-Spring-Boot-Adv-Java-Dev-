# Notes 
Spring Boot is an open-source framework built on top of the Spring Framework, designed to simplify the development of standalone, production-grade Spring applications. It aims to reduce the effort and time required to set up and configure Spring projects, allowing developers to focus on writing application logic rather than dealing with extensive configuration.

- It is popular for the auto-configuration.

#### What is dependency Injection 
Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring Boot is a core principle and a design pattern that facilitates building loosely coupled, modular, and testable applications. It's an implementation of the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle, where the framework (Spring Boot) manages the dependencies of your application's components rather than the components managing their own dependencies.

#### Spring Initializr 
Spring Initializr is a website or web-based tool used to set up Spring Boot projects in an easier and efficient manner. Spring Boot projects can be set up manually, but the configuration might be time-consuming and confusing.

By default spring boot runing via Tomcat server on 8080 port.
